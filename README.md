# Please try FormBricks it's far more feature rich and seems like it's an ethical FOSS alternative.
If you depend on this project still at this point please consider adopting the project.  However I will wish to ensure that it will be in good hands and not just going to be another piece in the supply chain problems for FOSS.

[Demo](https://demo.ohmyform.org/) Username and password are just `demo`.  We will reset the demo instance at least once for every new release and possibly more often so don't rely on it for sending actual forms expect no notice for resets.

> An *open source alternative to TypeForm* that can create stunning mobile-ready forms, surveys and questionnaires.
